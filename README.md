# Ant simulation web application
Repository containing a web application that simulates ants.
## Instructions
### Creating the Back-end
1. Download NPM and Node.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open your favorite code editor to the root of the project.
4. Run the following commands in a terminal that is open to the root's location.
```
npm i express
npm i body-parser
npm i -D nodemon
npm i cors
```
5. Start the server by running the following command in the terminal in the `server` directory.
```
npm run dev
```
Your server should be now running on `localhost:5000/api/sim`. Check the message in your browser as well as the logging in your terminal that ran the server.

Whenever you modify and save your code, `nodemon` will automatically restart the server so your changes will be visible in the browser immediately.
